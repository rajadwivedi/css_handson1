    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

    <div class="con">
        <ol>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>

            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on scree, paper, or in other media.</li>

            <li>
                <span class="td">Css is not necessary</span><span class="bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="i">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="sm">
        <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="ls">
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>

            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>

            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>

            <li>
               The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles is external CSS files. However, <span class="bg2">in this tutorial 
                we will use inline and internal styles,
               </span>because this is easier to demostrate, and easier for you to try it yourself
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

           When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements ID, on the other hand, applies a style to unique elemen. ID is also
           special in that you can see use a special URL to link directly to an element and It's used by JavaScript.
           
        </p>

        <p>
           In CSS, selectors are used to target a specfic element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has targeted , a style or set of styles can be  applied 
           to the element.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly are used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a 
            style should be applied.
